"""ODE problem descriptions.

Common descriptions of ODE problems that should appear in multiple docstrings
(such as the meaning of the equations, a reference, etc.), can be placed
here and prepended to the respective docstring via
`fun.__doc__ = <common_doc> + fun.__doc__`. This makes sure that
every occurrence of, e.g., the Pleiades problem, comes with
an appropriate description of the dynamics.

A common (non-binding) template for this kind of information is

```

<long_description>

<maths_and/or_latex_code>

<why_it_is_interesting>

<references_and/or_bibtex>

<see_also>

```

but do what you like.
