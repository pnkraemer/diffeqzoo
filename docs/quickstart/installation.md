# Installation

## Stable release

To install odezoo, run

```commandline
pip install odezoo
```

This is the preferred method to install odezoo, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

!!! warning

    Currently, the package is not on pypi, so the above installation does not work.


## Most recent version

To get the most recent version from GitHub, run

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/pnkraemer/odezoo.git
```
