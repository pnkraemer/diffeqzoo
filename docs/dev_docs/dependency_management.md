# Install the dependencies

!!! warning "Inexperienced ``poetry`` user"

    This project uses ``poetry`` to manage dependencies, but in a very inexperienced way.
    If you know how to improve its usage, please make some noise!

In the ODEZoo, we use `poetry` to install and manage dependencies.
How does it work?
