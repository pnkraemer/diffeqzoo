# Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in CHANGELOG.md).
Then run:

```
$ poetry run bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags
```

GitHub Actions will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
